# HackX-shebytes
Our aim is to build a platform which is specifically meant foe the queer community ,which does not let them feel left out and makes sure that their voices reach to the concerned authority and that the actions are taken for the same .
We have made a huge e-commerce section for the people where they can buy the type of clothes they prefer . The option of personalizing their clothes is also added alongside . We want to make sure that their rights are not taken away and that they get equal status as any other gender .For this we have added multiple options under our services section .
We have put our best foot forward to make a good change in the world.
